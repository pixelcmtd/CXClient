# The Coice Against The Updater
We have been working on a good updating experience for CXClient a lot and we
think our updater is really nice, but we still decided against it, here's why:
* "Everything's tied to a stupid webserver, that's gonna go obsolete in a few
years."  
If we run this updater on every shutdown (how it should be used), once our
servers go offline, it will annoy you on every shutdown.
* "I won't be able to reminise about 20 years from now"  
If you *have* to update, you won't be able to use the really old versions in a
few years, which would be fatal retro-wise.  

The two quotes from Bryan Lunduke, he said that in his talk
"programmers_are_evil();".
